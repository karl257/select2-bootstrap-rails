Integrate Select2 and Select2 Bootstrap 5 Theme  with the Rails asset pipeline.

# Select2 with Bootstrap 5 theme for rails asset pipeline

[Select2](https://github.com/select2/select2) is a jQuery based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results.

The `select2-bootstrap-rails` gem integrates the `Select2` jQuery plugin with the Rails asset pipeline.

## Usage

### Install select2-bootstrap-rails gem

Add `select2-bootstrap-rails` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

	gem "select2-bootstrap-rails"

### Include select2-bootstrap-rails javascript assets

Add the following to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

	//= require select2

To add `select2-full.js` instead of `select2.js`, add the following instead :

	//= require select2-full

### Include select2-bootstrap-rails stylesheet assets

Add to your `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

	@import select2

If you are using Twitter Boostrap you need to also require the bootstrap theme CSS in addition to the above require.

	@import select2-bootstrap-5-theme

To apply the theme, tell Select2 to do so by passing `bootstrap` to the [`theme`](https://select2.github.io/examples.html#themes) option when initializing Select2:

    $( "#dropdown" ).select2({
        theme: "bootstrap"
    });

## Internationalization (i18n)

The `select2-bootstrap-rails` now supports multiple languages.

Add the following to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

	//= require select2_locale_"any possible language"

To apply the language, pass whatever language you'd like to use to the [`language`](https://select2.github.io/examples.html#language) option when initializing Select2:

    $( "#dropdown" ).select2({
        language: "zh-TW"
    });

Possible languages:

	af, ar, az, bg, bn, bs, ca, cs, da, de, dsb, el, en, eo, es, et, eu, fa, fi, fr, gl, he, hi, hr, hsb, hu, hy, id, is, it, ja, ka, km, ko, lt, lv, mk, ms, nb, ne, nl, pa, pl, ps, pt, pt-BR, ro, ru, sk, sl, sq, sr, sr-Cyrl, sv, th, tk, tr, uk, vi, zh-CN, zh-TW

## Example
Code [here](https://github.com/argerim/select_2_example)

## Fix
### IE8 Invalid Character
IE8 doesn't support some unescaped Unicode character and need to quote keys in object literals
You need some configurations for [Uglifier](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier) to do the work.
Add to your `config/environments/production.rb`

       require 'uglifier'
       config.assets.js_compressor = Uglifier.new(output: {ascii_only: true, quote_keys: true})
